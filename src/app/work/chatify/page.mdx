# Chatify - AI Music Recommendations

An intelligent chatbot that combines OpenAI's conversational AI with Spotify's music catalog to deliver personalized music recommendations through natural conversation.

## The Problem

Music discovery often feels overwhelming:
- Streaming platforms show generic recommendations
- Users struggle to articulate their mood or preferences
- No conversational way to explore new music
- Limited context about why songs are recommended

## Solution Architecture

### Backend Infrastructure

<TechStack>
<Tech>Node.js</Tech>
<Tech>Express</Tech>
<Tech>OpenAI API</Tech>
<Tech>Spotify Web API</Tech>
<Tech>OAuth 2.0</Tech>
</TechStack>

**Core Components:**
- **Authentication Service** - Handles Spotify OAuth flow and session management
- **Conversation Engine** - Processes user input through OpenAI's GPT models
- **Music Intelligence** - Translates conversational context into Spotify search parameters
- **Recommendation Pipeline** - Fetches and filters music based on AI insights

### Frontend Experience

<TechStack>
<Tech>HTML5</Tech>
<Tech>CSS3</Tech>
<Tech>JavaScript</Tech>
<Tech>Responsive Design</Tech>
</TechStack>

**User Journey:**
1. **Connect Spotify** - Seamless OAuth integration
2. **Natural Conversation** - Chat about music preferences, mood, activities
3. **Smart Recommendations** - AI-powered song suggestions with context
4. **Interactive Playback** - Preview tracks and add to playlists

## Technical Implementation

### AI Integration Strategy

The system uses a multi-step AI pipeline:

```javascript
async function generateRecommendations(userMessage, conversationHistory) {
  // 1. Analyze user intent and extract musical preferences
  const musicContext = await openai.chat.completions.create({
    model: "gpt-3.5-turbo",
    messages: [
      { role: "system", content: MUSIC_ANALYST_PROMPT },
      ...conversationHistory,
      { role: "user", content: userMessage }
    ]
  });

  // 2. Convert AI insights to Spotify search parameters
  const searchParams = parseAIResponse(musicContext);
  
  // 3. Fetch recommendations from Spotify
  const tracks = await spotify.search(searchParams);
  
  // 4. Generate explanations for recommendations
  return await explainRecommendations(tracks, musicContext);
}
```

### Session Management

Implemented secure session handling for personalized experiences:
- **JWT-based authentication** for stateless session management
- **Refresh token rotation** to maintain long-term access
- **Conversation memory** to provide context-aware recommendations
- **Privacy-first design** with user data encryption

## Key Features

**Conversational Intelligence:**
- Natural language processing for music preferences
- Context-aware recommendations based on mood, activity, or genre
- Memory of previous conversations for personalized suggestions

**Spotify Integration:**
